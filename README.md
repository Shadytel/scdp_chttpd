To build, simple type 'make'. Please note that libmicrohttpd and libsqlite3 libraries will be needed on your system for this project to function. Upon starting, it will be listening on port 8082.

To run the configuration generator, you'll need an appropriate scdp_peers.db for the generator to parse. If one doesn't exist, type 'make sample' to build a simple program that will make a sample configuration.
